# Scribe

This tool allows you to add, store, search and remove short notes.
Personally I use it to have around short programming pieces of code, formulas, tips and hints from various areas.

Scribe saves changes everytime you add a new record (Add new). You can also do it manually.

Scribe is under development. Further features are in progress.
